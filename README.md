🎯 Comprehensive Project Description
Two-Way Inventory Synchronization System (Shopify & Google Sheets)

This project establishes a reliable, two-way sync between Shopify's live inventory and an external Google Sheets planning hub, utilizing a modular n8n design. It uses Workflow A (Read) for scheduled master data synchronization and Workflow B (Write) for instant updates and alerts. The system ensures data integrity by preventing critical errors (like negative stock), provides proactive low-stock alerts, and guarantees scalability for growing product catalogs.
